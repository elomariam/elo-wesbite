  <h1> Welcome to my website! </h1> 
  <h2> Mariam Atoyan</h2>
  <h3> Biography</h3>
  <p> I am a student at the University of California, Irvine. I am majoring in Public Health Policy and minoring in Health Informatics. I am interested in learning ways to implement and improve health care through the use of data science and technology. And I'm very excited to finally be graduating this Spring! A little fun fact, when I am able to, I enjoy traveling (close and far) and playing tennis. </p>
